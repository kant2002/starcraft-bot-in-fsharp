The BWAPI web site    http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/


1. Introduction
------------------------

Build Instructions:

1. Extract the entire zip to a folder on your computer.

2. Copy the contents of Chaoslauncher/ to your Chaos Launcher folder.

3. Copy the contents of Starcraft/ to your actual Starcraft folder.

4. Copy the contents of WINDOWS/ to your C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT folder (which
   ever your version of Windows has).  You can actually copy these Dlls to anywhere
   on your system PATH.  


All three projects are now built. If you do not intend to build any projects or do 
not have Visual C++ installed, then you must install the Visual C++ Redistributables
(vcredist_x86.exe) included in this archive in order to use BWAPI.

To run the Example AI Module:

1. Copy Release/ExampleAIModule.dll to
   <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/AI/ExampleAIModule.dll

2. Open <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini and set ai to
   bwapi-data/AI/ExampleAIModule.dll if it isn't already.
   
3. Run Chaoslauncher with BWAPI Injector checked. You can also check W-MODE
   to have Broodwar run in a window rather than full-screen.

4. Start Starcraft: Broodwar and create a match.

   
To run the Example AI Client:

1. Open <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini and set ai_dll to NULL (or some
   other file name that doesn't exist).

2. Run Release/ExampleAIClient.exe

3. Run Chaoslauncher with BWAPI Injector checked.

4. Start Starcraft: Broodwar and create a match.


Debug Mode
----------
To run either the AI Module in debug mode,
compile the projects in DEBUG mode and copy the files from
Chaoslauncher/Debug/ to your Chaoslauncher folder.

2. The BroodWar Terrain Analyzer
--------------------------------

   This release of BWAPI also comes with BWTA, the Brood War Terrain
Analyzer, which analyzes the map and locates the choke points and possible
expansion locations. BWTA is still a work-in-progress and does not work on
every map, so it may crash the game. To run BWTA and analyze a map, type
"/analyze" in the game chat while playing a match with either the Example AI
Module loaded or the Example AI Client running. This will freeze the game for
a couple minutes while BWTA analyzes the map. Once BWTA is done analyzing the
map, the game will unfreeze and superimpose the outlines of regions,
chokepoints, and base locations on the screen using BWAPI's draw commands.
