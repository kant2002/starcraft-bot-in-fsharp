THE PRELUDE		http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chrsmith/archive/2010/03/18/writing-a-starcraft-bot-in-f.aspx

The BWAPI web site	http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/

------------------------

Instruction:

1. Download last version of BWAPI https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/
 a. Copy the contents of Chaoslauncher/ to your Chaos Launcher folder.
 b. Copy the contents of Starcraft/ to your actual Starcraft folder.
 c. Copy the contents of WINDOWS/ to your C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT folder or...  You can actually copy these Dlls to anywhere on your system PATH.  

2. Working with sources:
 a. There are three projects in the solution. First is StarCraftConnector  which in output gives StarCraftConnector.dll, which is the C++ library built on top of BWAPI that broadcasts game state to a socket. Later a C# application will listen to that data and send messages back to the StarCraft game. 
  1. Build project.
  2. Copy "bin" folder from Extra to your StarCraftConnector folder. 
  3. Enter the solution directory StarCraftConnector\bin\Release and open "AIModuleLoader to StarcraftConnector" shortcut. It will get ready your builds of strcraftconnector for the game.

 b. Second project is named StarCraftBot9K Client (C#) will listen for those events 

 c. And finally StarCraftBot9K (F#) will do decision making. 

3. How to start your bot:
 a. Launch the project (for example by running it in debug mode)
 b. Launch the game! (And create your custom battle)

As Chris already written in his blog just unleash StarCraftBot9K! Simply start run the application. It will begin listening to the socket until StarCraftConnector begins broadcasting.

P.S. And I recommend to use ChaosLauncher for running the game: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=65196
